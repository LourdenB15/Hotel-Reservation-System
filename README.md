# Hotel Reservation System

## Overview
This is a console-based Hotel Reservation System application built with C# that demonstrates the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

## Features
- Room management (Standard and Deluxe rooms)
- Make and cancel reservations
- View all available rooms
- Input validation and error handling

## OOP Principles Demonstrated

### ✅ Encapsulation
- Private fields with public getters/setters
- Validation in property setters
- Protected access modifiers where appropriate

### ✅ Inheritance
- Base `Room` class
- Derived `StandardRoom` and `DeluxeRoom` classes
- Shared properties and methods in base class

### ✅ Polymorphism
- Method overriding (`DisplayRoomInfo`)
- Runtime polymorphism through base class references

### ✅ Abstraction
- Abstract `Room` class with abstract method
- Implementation details hidden in derived classes
